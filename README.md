### LindIn-Learning-Downloader

LindIn-Learning-Downloader is a mini program that I personally researched how to download linkedin learning videos.
It uses a combination of Selenium and Requests two Python libraries.

Selenium: Sign In the linkedin learning by getting the cookies

Requests: Download the videos


#### How to use it

<b>1. Clone the code</b>

<b>2. Paste the course links you want to download in LyndaCourseList.txt</b>

<b>3. Sign In LinkedIn Learning in Chrome.</b>

<b>4. Run the LinkedIn Downloader.py.</b>

That's all you need to do.
